#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project Overview
--------------------

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The following are the steps involved

 1)	 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

 2)	 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

 3) 	 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

 4) 	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

 5) 	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in the repository:
---------------------------

1) 	README.md  – This file 

2) 	CodeBook.md – This document explains the project in detail. It explains the source information and explains the dataset variables. The Data extraction and Tranformation is explained in detail with the tablename and variables names in order to generate a tidy data set.

3) 	Run_analysis.r – R script file that loads the raw dataset, merges the dataset, applies descriptive names and labels the variables appropriately. Finds the mean of the measurements based on subject and activity and creates a tidy data set.

4) 	Tidy_Averagedata.txt – The tidy data set that got generated post Data Transformation.
